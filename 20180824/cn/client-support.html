In other words, when the old contract with futures as the subject matter expires, we automatically renew the contract, so that the subject matter corresponding to the contract will be changed into a new main futures contract, so that long-term investors can hold positions all the time without changing the cost of holding positions. However, we will adjust and balance the price difference between the old and new contracts accordingly. Customers will not get unexpected gains or losses. Renewal profit or loss is only used to balance the change of position value caused by the price difference between the old and new contracts.
                                    If you want to avoid the spread of the contract, you need to close your flat before closing date.</p>
